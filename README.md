# OOP
This is a github repository of exemplar OOP projects to go along with my OOP guides

Each week will include:
- the beginning template which you should download and use to follow the guide with
- The exemplar solutions which you can check your solutions against incase you have any errors when following the video

Remember plagiarising is an offence especially at university so I advise you to not copy solutions WORD FOR WORD

Remember you can reach me on discord in the server or in dms for any help/advice: Rook#7728
